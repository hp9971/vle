            Virtual Learning Environment is a environment&nbsp; &nbsp;that is developed for the purpose of teaching the students&nbsp; 
            &nbsp;detailed and genuine knowledge about the course and the&nbsp; &nbsp;content in the course. This software was developed
            so that&nbsp; &nbsp;the student don't have to physically present in the classes&nbsp; &nbsp;but can clearify his/her doubts at any
            time from the faculty&nbsp; &nbsp;available. It provides notes in the form of texts/pdf,audio&nbsp; &nbsp;and video tutorials which
            the enrolled students can access at&nbsp; &nbsp;any time after login into the system.<br><br>
            
            &nbsp;This is an beta version of the software that was developed&nbsp; &nbsp;for the purpose of experimenting and learning.
